    "### Changes and modifications to the PS-FCN model -: \n",
    "This section briefly highlights the changes I tried to implement to the PS-FCN model. The code given by the authors is very well written and organized but a bit too modular, which I tried to simplify in my implementation. The code structure is quite compact since I have kept only the bare minimum options as arguments, which simplifies the argument parsing in my implementation. For instance, my code allows the use of only the Adam optimizer and cosine loss. The data parsing code for the train and test dataset is same as that used by the authors due to time constraints. These are the approaches I tried in my implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "-  *Using masked loss* The cosine loss used in the paper averages the cosine loss between the predicted and true normal over all pixels. To deal with the pixels which contribute more to the loss in a better way, I introduced stochasticity to the loss function. For every pixel in a batch/image, a cosine loss was computed. This loss matrix was then normalized, and a bernoulli mask was generated by sampling every element of the mask with the corresponding pixel/element value of the normalized loss matrix. The loss matrix was then masked using this approach before calculating the mean loss for a batch.\n",
    "\n",
    "-  *Using Batch Normalization* Batch normalization is a popular technique used for improving accuracy and ensuring faster convergence while training. I tried training the model using batch normalization for all layers in the Siamese network and obtained the results shown below. The paper does not mention anything about using batch normalization, and the pre-trained models given by the authors are also obtained without batch normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "-  *Using Dilated Convolutions* Dilated convolutions support exponential expansion of the receptive field without loss of resolution or coverage. Since the paper mentions that the algorithm does not perform well on dark images, I felt that increasing the receptive field in the first layer might be helpful hence tried this approach. The next section analyzes the effect of these modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results \n",
    "\n",
    "On training the PS-FCN architecture with batch normalization and dilated convolution for 30 epochs and 8 image light pairs per sample on the blobby dataset, I obtained a mean of error of 12.023 on testing it with the DiLiGent Dataset with 96 image light pairs per object. The image results for the 9 objects can be found in the `ResultsNotebook` folder. Here I display the normal maps inferred by PS-FCN for 3 of the objects inferred using a model with dilated convolutions and without batch normalization -:\n",

    "The differences in the ground truth and estimates can be seen clearly. We see that PS-FCN is not able to detect the finer sharp features in the objects very accurately. \n",

    "The mean error reported in the paper over all objects in the DiLiGenT dataset is 8.39. It is important to note here that the mean error reported in the paper is using a model trained on both sculpture dataset and the Blobby dataset, while I have trained the model only on one dataset.\n",

    "The above table suggests that one does not get any improvements using batch normalization on this dataset, and that the performance slightly worsens on using batch normalization. Comparing the results visual results in the ResultsNotebook folder shows no stark difference as well. On Training the model without batch normalization and without a dilated convolution layer, the mean error was observed to be 9.805. Hence one can infer that using these 2 techniques does not give any significant improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "On observing that batch normalization does not fetch much improvement, I trained the model using the masked loss approach without batch normalization on a similar setup as in the above experiment. Using the masked loss suffers significantly in performance on the test dataset, giving a mean loss of 15 as compared to the other approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other ideas to test and aspects to work on-:\n",
    "Mentioning some of the other aspects that can be further pondered over in future -:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Using a prior or a different architecture to improve performance for uncalibrated PS-FCN. The given paper just removes the extra concatenated $3 \\times h \\times w$ image from the input to handle uncalibrated measurements, but there is no intuition as to why the model works well even for uncalibrated measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Incorporating the lighting direction more effectively in the model. In the paper the authors create an image out of the lighting vector for a particular image, and concatenate it with the input. Investigating the effect of augmenting the lighting vector at a later conv layer would be interesting. \n",
    "\n",
    "-  Improving detection of finer object features. Since we observed that PS-FCN suffers in performance at locations or for objects with finer surface features, this seems a direction one can pursue to improve the network architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion -:\n",
    "We observed that the masked loss function despite being an interesting approach gives no improvements. It needs to be tested with more data for a better comparison. Using dilated convolutions is a marginally better approach. Using dilated convolutions for more layers in the network may lead to a more significant improvement, and needs to be tested thoroughly."
